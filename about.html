        Hello! My name is Jay, but I go by Dusken online. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am a hyena VTuber with a passion for gaming, tech, and making information more accessible.
        I love providing content that helps others navigate the complex digital world that we live in. When I'm not
        online, you might find me exploring a nearby hiking trail - though I admit, I spend most of my hours indoors,
        deep into a new project, reading, or learning music.

        <h1> What You'll Find Here</h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Reviews and Insights: </strong>Honest takes on the games I play and what I may have
        learned during my experience. I play a wide variety that grows wider, from obscure indie games to the latest
        AAA titles. </li>
            <li><strong>Streaming and Content Creation: </strong>Guides on using OBS, Streamer.bot, VNyan, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>VRChat Avatar Documentation: </strong>Lots of VRChat creators make you use Discord to ask a simple quesiton.
        Here, my experience with different things I do on an avatar will be documented, as well as simple guides and important
        information that the authors release in their Discord but nowhere else.</li>
            <li><strong>Tech & Development: </strong>Exploring software development (including this blog!) and sharing my thoughts on
        the technologies and languages that I use. Significant hardware and game news will also be translated here with my personal
        take.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Thoughts & Experiences: </strong>A mix of gaming journalism, project updates, and general musings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Why this blog?</h1>
    </p>
    <p>
        I started dusken.blog to document my experiences and to help others along the way. Creating content online, particularly
        in artist circles within the furry community, can feel full of gatekeepers. The ones who don't gatekeep often do not have a great
        method of sharing, relying on platforms such as Discord. I want to break those barriers by making the information open and easy
        to access and understand.

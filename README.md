# Welcome to my GitHub Page Repo

As I learn more about web development and how to build software and get it to do what I want, my progress will be tracked here. 

I am taking myself through an online cirriculum called [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

This is a personal project. I am in no way affiliated with anything presented here or on [my blog.](http://dusken.blog)

Thank you for checking out my small corner of the internet. <3
